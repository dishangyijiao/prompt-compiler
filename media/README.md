# Media folder

Use this folder for images linked from README.md (e.g. screenshots, diagrams).

For **Store screenshots** (extension detail page): take them with Raycast’s Window Capture (Advanced Preferences → set hotkey, e.g. ⌘⇧⌥+M), open your command, press the hotkey, tick **Save to Metadata**. Specs: 2000×1250 px, 16:10, PNG. Add 3–6 screenshots.
